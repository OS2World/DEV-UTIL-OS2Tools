# The CVSSEC tool scans this file to determine write access.
# The concerned users will have to be in the "writers" file as well.
#
# The idea is to provide fine granular access control within the 
# repository directories, thus avoiding having to setup multiple 
# repositories.
#
# - comment lines start with a "#"
# - an access control that is also valid for all subsequent 
#   subdirectories ends with a "*"
#   e. g. /my/directory* would match /my/directory and /my/directory/whatever ...
