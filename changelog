        - Have imported the common classes from Odin32 /tools/common.
          Its mostly file and fileformat classes. These are not at
          all completed, but they are extended when needed.
          BindTools uses them.
        - FastDep is optimized slightly. don't scan old files if we can
          use existing .depend file.
        - Linker option /EXE is /EXEPACK not /EXECutable. Corrected this.
